prompt = '''
Jade is trying to implment the binary search herself, but she mistakenly wrote the following code:
```
if (high <= low)
    return -1;
```

Assume other code remains the same as the material. If the array is `1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12`, which of them can be found correctly by Jade's code?

    "A is incorrect. The problem is that the code will not find the element when it has been narrowed down to a single element (low == high). In this case, 1, 5, 9, 12 will not be found. Since 3, 7, 10 are at the middle position when the array is narrowed down, they can be found.",
