int main(void) {
  int n = 1;
  printf("%d %d", n, addOne(n));
  return 0;
}

int addOne(int n) {
  n += 1;
  return n;
}

explainations = [
    "A is incorrect. The variable `n` in `addOne` is a local variable and is not the same as the variable `n` in `main`. Thus the value of `n` in `main` is not changed.",
    "B is correct. The variable `n` in `addOne` is a local variable and is not the same as the variable `n` in `main`. Thus the value of `n` in `main` is not changed. Also, the return value of `addOne(n)` is 2.",
    "C is incorrect. The variable `n` in `addOne` is a local variable and is not the same as the variable `n` in `main`. Thus the value of `n` in `main` is not changed. Also, the return value of `addOne(n)` is 2.",
    "D is incorrect. The function `addOne` returns the value of `n` plus 1, which is 2. Thus, the return value of ``addOne(n)` in `main` 2."
