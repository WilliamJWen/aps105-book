      "prompt": "Jade writes a program to print the following figure (input is 3):\n<br>\n`\n11111\n12221\n12321\n12221\n11111\n`\n<br>\nThe figure is a lots of squares. Each square is made of numbers. The numbers in the square are the same. The numbers in the square are from 1 to the half of the width of the square. The width of the square is an odd number. The width of the square is 5 in the example above.\n\nHere is the code Jade writes:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n = 7;\n    for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++) {\n        for (int col = 1; col <= n; col++) {\n            int temp_row = row;\n            if (row >= n / 2 + 1) {\n                temp_row = n - row + 1;\n            }\n            int num = temp_row;\n            if (col < temp_row - 1) {\n                num = col;\n            }\n            if (col > n - temp_row + 1) {\n                num = n - col + 1;\n            }\n            printf(\"%d\", num);\n            printf(\"\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nHow many errors are there in the code?\n",
