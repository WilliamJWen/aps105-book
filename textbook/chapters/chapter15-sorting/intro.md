There are several sorting algorithms, but will only focus on:

1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Quicksort

**Disclaimer:** We discuss these sorting algorithms to sort integers in an array in ascending order. The same algorithms can be used to sort integers in descending order or to sort characters or strings in lexicographical order or to sort nodes in a linked list. However, we will not discuss these variations in this chapter.
