# Development Cycle

While data and instructions are stored in binary format, we do not write programs in binary. It is too difficult. Instead, we use a programming language. Our program written in a programming language can be *translated* to machine language/binary format. 

The process of translating a program written in a programming language to machine language is called ``compilation''. In this process, your instructions will be translated to 0s and 1s. The process of compilation is done by a program called a compiler.
