# Do-while loop

In the previous section, we discussed repetition in programming using a while loop. In this section, we will discuss the do-while loop. The do-while loop is similar to the while loop. The only difference is that the do-while loop will always execute **at least once**, even if the condition is `false`. This is because the condition is checked at the end of the loop. 

Syntax of the do-while is as follows:

```{code-block} c
do {
  <statements>;
} while (<condition>);
```

The order of execution is as follows:



Let's look at an example:

**Code**
```{code-block} c
```
