# Pass more values to a function

In this section, we will see an exercise were we need to pass to a function two inout parameters are return one.

## Worked exercise of a modified version of Question 7 in 2017 Midterm Exam

Write a program that takes in three integers from the user. The `main` function should call a function named median to find the median among these integers, which is the number at the middle. Your function should take 3 int-type parameters and return the value of the number at the middle. For example, with integers $2$, $7$, and $5$ as input, the function returns 5; with integers $6$, $4$, and $6$ as input, the function returns $6$.
