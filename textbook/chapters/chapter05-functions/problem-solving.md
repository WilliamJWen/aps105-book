# How to solve a problem? 

1. Identify the problem their program should solve 
2. Break the problem into smaller sub-problems, if the problem is too big
3. Think of a plan to a solution to each sub-problem
4. For each sub-problem, think of the variables you need to store data
5. Think of the structure of the solution to each sub-problem
6. Think of how to integrate the solutions to the sub-problems into a single program

This is the process of **designing** a program. It is important to design a program before you start typing code. This will save you a lot of time and effort.
